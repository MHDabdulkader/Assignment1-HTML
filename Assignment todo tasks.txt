Create a single-page responsive website using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks for this part).

The design should include:

·         A responsive navigation bar.

·         A hero section with a background image and text overlay.

·         A grid of four cards (with image, title, and description), that rearrange themselves based on screen size (using media queries).

·         Make sure the page is mobile-first, optimized for different screen sizes.

·         Key Technologies to Use:


create branch github:
git checkout -b feature/modal
Add and commit changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Add modal feature"

Push the feature branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/modal

Create a new branch for the "filter" feature
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/filter

git add .
git commit -m "Add filter functionality"
git push origin feature/filter


Merging into the main branch (after feature completion)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/modal
git push origin main
